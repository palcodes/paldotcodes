## Greetings, I'm Aayush

I'm a product engineer currently building for [myself](https://github.com/palcodes) and [Market.xyz](https://market.xyz). I like wearing many hats when building products, pretty much everything from making design decisions to writing the application to taking it to production *[something I need to do more].* While doing this is of course not easy, we can achieve greatness with just a bunch of good people around.

I've built a couple of apps that I am proud of, each one defining a step in my process of learning. I want to continue doing so while working on interesting projects with amazing people.

I like writing, but very often I find myself in the **think-wish-forget** loop. But today is one of those days when I shut up and do what I set out to do which is **think-do-iterate**. While constantly juggling through all kinds of emotions, experiences that life has to throw at me, I feel collected, resolved when I come across articles that inspire me in the most grounded manner, providing the most practical approach to forming a constructive habit. One such treasure is [Linus's blog](https://thesephist.com) and I'm shamelessly using his theme [Carlisle](https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app) as a base for my blog as it hit just the right chords with my current writing needs. I will on the side, work on my own version of the design and will release that when ready. No promises.

I want this blog to be a public collection of my musings about life, tech, travel, football and everything in between.
